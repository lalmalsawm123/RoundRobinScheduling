# Round Robin Scheduling Algorithm Simulation

## Overview
This is a simulation program that tests the performance of the Round Robin scheduling algorithm. It generates a set of "processes" with random arrival times and CPU burst times and runs the Round Robin algorithm for a set amount of time. The program records the average waiting time and turnaround time for each process and compares the results with the ideal scenario of a perfect scheduler.

## Requirements
As a computer systems engineer, the following requirements were met:

- [x] Design and implement the simulation program using the C programming language.
- [x] Generate a set of "processes" with random arrival times and CPU burst times using a random number generator.
- [x] Implement the Round Robin scheduling algorithm in the simulation program.
- [x] Run the simulation program for a set amount of time (e.g., 100 time units) and record the average waiting time and turnaround time for each process.
- [x] Compare the results of the simulation with the ideal scenario of a perfect scheduler.

## Usage
To run the simulation program, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
